*Case studies*:
1. Can we render a repo that stores (Python Jupyter notebooks) as Markdown files, e.g. the [Elegant Scipy Book](https://github.com/elegant-scipy/elegant-scipy)? Subscribe to [#1](https://github.com/mwouts/jupyter-book-experiments/issues/#1) or have a look to [`Elegant_Scipy_as_a_Jupyter_Book.md`](Elegant_Scipy_as_a_Jupyter_Book.md), which you can also run interactively on [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mwouts/jupyter-book-experiments/master?filepath=Elegant_Scipy_as_a_Jupyter_Book.md)

2. Can we render a Bookdown repo (R Markdown files with R code)? E.g. https://github.com/Robinlovelace/geocompr
